# Product Outline

### 2021 - Q1 Objective ﻿　﻿

Have a usable indicator recommendation WebAapp.

## Layered and modular Platform and App Approach

1. The WebApp, which contains the information specific to users, and the views and functionalities of the WebApp itself.
2. There is a middle layer API and functions that support the movement and access of data.
3. The base data/AI brain is to be able to be plugged into by MANY apps ... that focus on enabling people and planet to thrive in balance with prosperity.

 There are more modules being built into the [isgood.ai](http://isgood.ai) webapp once we've got this initial functionality built, but this basic system design holds true.
