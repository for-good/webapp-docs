## Getting Super Powers ü¶Ñ 

Becoming a super-hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```text
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world üåè 

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# We are still working on creating the code for this
echo 'Join isgood.ai and become part of the solution'
```
{% endcode %}
